    <p style="font-size: 25px; text-align: justify;margin:0; padding-bottom: 20px;">This is Nuruzzaman from Tangail district of Bangladesh. I like to smile always to release myself from any stress. My strong postion is to ignor everything. It help me more to keep me free & smiling. However I have compeleted my graduation & post graduation from Dhaka University in the department of Bangla. Now I am working as a teacher in an English Medium College name BAF Shaheen English Medium College which is the only English Medium College operated by Bangladesh Air Force. My hobby is to discover new places to travel. I am involved in recitation & staged drama. I am married & have 2 years baby boy.</p>
